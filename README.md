Please do not change the code if you are only going to play as it will mess the game up and could lead to changes that would let you cheat.
unless you are chaning the code to make the game better. If you want to be on the leaderboard take a video of yourself beating all of the levels and then e-mail the video to jrcmilkz@gmail.com and we will review it and put you on the leaderboard.
